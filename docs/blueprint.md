- Background color: Very dark blue (#0A192F) background provides the base for the 'Aftersoft Galaxy' aesthetic.
- Accent color: Vibrant neon blue (#40E0D0) is used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements like buttons and links. This vibrant blue creates an element of visual interest against the dark background, emulating a space theme.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers and titles to offer a modern, digital impression
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) offers clean, readable text.
- Use clean and simple line icons. Ensure icons are consistent with the space theme in the hero section.
- Use subtle animations and transitions when navigating between sections and when new content loads to keep users engaged and draw interest to site sections and details. Special animated effects resembling stars and meteors, creating a dynamic and captivating space atmosphere are only present on the home page's header.
